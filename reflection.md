Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class is about a drone. It can grab and drop things, move on the ground, and fly, depending on the control. After each movement, it can self-check the battery load and send out warning for charging if needed.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
move() is an additional method that I implement alongside those listed in the interface. It helps the drone to move on the ground and tell the user where it is after the move.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I tried to fly with a direction and it worked partly. But the direction is limited.
I would suggest others to start simple, with a work but not perfect code, and then elaborate the code.
